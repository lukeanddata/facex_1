# Face Expression Recognition Project - Facex_1

## Overview

This project delves into Data Science and Machine Learning, focusing on the potential of machine learning in classifying human emotions from facial expressions. While modest in scale, the project extensively explores various models, illuminating the nuances of emotion recognition technology.

// note - This project is first stand-alone project of mine. Facex_1 version will be kept as the 'raw' footprint of its further (potential) evolution.

## Dataset

### FER 2013 Dataset

The project is centered around the Facial Expression Recognition 2013 (FER 2013) dataset, a key resource in computer vision and emotion AI. This dataset contains 35,887 grayscale images, labeled with seven different emotions, offering a robust base for model training. 

### Additional Datasets

In addition to FER 2013, the project utilizes other datasets to evaluate and test the robustness of the models. This approach is aimed at understanding the models' generalizability and performance in diverse scenarios.

## Addressing Challenges

The project tackles inherent challenges in the FER 2013 dataset, such as class imbalance and noisy data. This involves applying the models to various datasets for a comprehensive understanding of emotion recognition complexities.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of the project is to create models for emotion classification. The focus is on gaining a deeper understanding of the factors influencing the performance, rather than achieving perfect accuracy. Key areas of exploration include:

- **Neural Network Capabilities:** Exploring the strengths and limitations of neural networks in emotion classification.
- **Model Performance Analysis:** Analyzing the performance of different models in classifying specific emotions versus their versatility in broader emotion recognition.

## Academic Relevance

While not a primary goal, the project's use of the FER 2013 dataset and the developed models have indirect relevance in academic research, contributing insights to the field of emotion AI.

// note - This project and its further stages will be later used in master thesis.

## Conclusion

This project is a comprehensive exploration into neural networks for emotion recognition, focusing on understanding the factors influencing model performance. It aims to provide significant insights into emotion AI, going beyond mere accuracy metrics.
